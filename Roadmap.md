# Nthing Roadmap

Things I'm thinking about adding:

## Short term (probably next)

- **Export to PDF/HTML** - should be straightforward with Electron's print API
- **Outline/TOC sidebar** - parse headers and make them clickable
- **Interactive task lists** - `- [ ]` checkboxes that actually work in the preview

## Medium term (would be nice)

- **Dark theme** - people keep asking about this
- **File tree sidebar** - for working with multiple markdown files in a folder
- **Strikethrough support** - `~~text~~` rendering

## Long term (maybe)

- **Math equations** - LaTeX/KaTeX for academic writing
- **Diagram support** - Mermaid for flowcharts and stuff
- **Export to Word** - .docx export, probably need pandoc for this

## Philosophy

The goal is to keep it simple. Not trying to compete with full IDEs or bloated editors. Just want a clean markdown editor that doesn't get in the way.

If you want something specific, open an issue. Or submit a PR if you're feeling adventurous.
