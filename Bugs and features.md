# Bugs & features
- ~preview formatting for yaml frontmatter and tags in writing focus~
- ~Find & Find&Replace dialogue box should be moveable~
- ~edit option: turn marked lines into bullet point list, numbered list.~
- ~Title bar: include filename without extension and some form of "saved" status, perhaps: not saved, last saved timestamp?~
- ~ctrl+1 still does not open recent file 1, etc.~
- Also if another file is already open, pop warning box "are you sure you want to open another file, you will leave current file. Make sure you have saved first." or something similar, perhaps a save/save as button for the currently open file?
- find & find replace does not highlight the word anymore, but stays focused on the dialogue box as we want. The yellow highlight appears, but it seems to be offset wrongly, it is not on the word searched for and it does not move if the text move. It looks like an overlay that is out of "sync".
- ~the standard behavior of bullet and number lists should apply, if i hit enter on a line that has a bullet/number it should automatically continue adding a bullet/next-number on the new line and if i hit enter one more time, it should remove it from that new line. This is standard is all editing software now.~
- ~"Last saved - just now" is fine if the save was within seconds, but its not very telling when i come back to the window 1 hour later and i look at the save status and it says "Last saved - just now".~
- toggle autosave on/off in file menu, perhaps with options: 1min, 30min, 1hour? i dont know whats good intervals to provide as options, what are others offering?
- file association
- in writing focus with show formatting on, title bar save status does not change from Last saved just now to Not saved if i make changes. It does change to Last saved just now if i save.
- in writing focus with show formatting, bullet list continues as it should pr standard behavior, this does not happen when show formatting is turned off, nor does it work in editor mode.
- i am not sure if this is intended or if it is a spinoff from the yellow highlighting on FIND. When i mark text now it gets a yellow background instead of blue.
- i cannot undo insert table?
